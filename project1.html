            <h1>Monster Mix & Match</h1>
            <img src="img/project1/Menu.png" width="50%">
            <p> Monster Mix & Match is an interactive application for kids that focuses on creating a monster avatar given the body parts provided. Our motivation for this project is to allow children to explore their creativity
                through the flexible options our avatar creation interface provides them. Growing up, we were used to avatar creation games that were more "cookie cutter" where when you, for example, select a pair of eyes, they 
                would automatically be placed on the area where eyes are normally located. We wanted to make an interface that was more open to imagination, so we added the functionality of dragging body parts to any location the 
                kid wants, and also the option to resize, rotate, and add more than one type of body part. The model for our project is a monster because after all, it is not weird for a monster to have 6 eyes, floating arms, and 
                upside-down features!  
            </p>

            <!-- 1. Design Sketch Section -->
            <h3> Design Sketches </h3>
            <p> The first step of our design process was to each brainstorm 10 sketches of ideas we had for an interactive app for kids. Since there were 4 of us, there were a total of 40 different ideas! A lot of our ideas revolved 
                being educational and having informative windows pop up when the user clicks on an object. Although most of our ideas were gravitating towards that concept, we ended up choosing something completely different, which 
                was some kind of avatar creation game. We chose this idea because it seemed more exciting and creative, and also because this type of application would most likely be more interesting for small kids, while having the 
                benefit of allowing them to explore their creativty. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Below are the 10 sketch ideas that I had:

            <!-- 2. Refined Sketch Section-->
            <h3>Sketch Details</h3>
            <p> After deciding on designing an avatar creation app, we expanded on this idea more by coming up with 10 sketch refinements/details. We had come up with different variations such as creating monsters, humans, animals and 
                also thought about details such as rotating and resizing parts, and also if we want to click on parts or just drag them onto the avatar. 
            </p>

                Below are our collective 10 refinement sketches:

            <!-- 3. Contribution -->
            <h3>Final Product & Contribution</h3>
            <p> Our final product was the monster variation of our idea. We decided on this variation because monsters are creatures that don't look "normal", so the kids will be able to be more creative of where they place and size 
                different body parts. The functionalities we decided to implement include: being able to resize a feature by holding on a corner of the feature and dragging it inward/outwards; rotating a feature by grabbing the top and 
                spinning the feature; dragging the feature anywhere on the creation box (so floating eyes are a yes!); having different colours for each feature; and finally, no limit to how many features you can put on!
            </p>
            <p>We coded our application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and used Glitch as our platform. We split up the project by having 2 people focus on the feature illustrations, 1 person focusing on the front-end coding, and 1 person 
                focusing on the back-end coding. From there, if anyone finished their parts early, then they would help out those who are working on the front-end and back-end.
            </p>
            <p>For my contribution to the project, I mainly worked with the front-end coding where I made the layout of the creation screen and inserted icons for each feature. Whenever the illustrations were finished, I would fill in the 
                feature slots with the drawings. Along with that, I also worked on some back-end functionalities such as flipping through the tabs in the features box.
