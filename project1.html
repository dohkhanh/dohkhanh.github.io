            <!-- 1. Overview-->
            <h3> Overview</h3>
            <p> Monster Mix & Match is an interactive application for kids that focuses on creating a monster avatar given the body parts provided. Our motivation for this project is to allow children to explore their creativity
                through the flexible options our avatar creation interface provides them. Growing up, we were used to avatar creation games that were more "cookie cutter" where when you, for example, select a pair of eyes, they 
                would automatically be placed on the area where eyes are normally located. We wanted to make an interface that was more open to imagination, so we added the functionality of dragging body parts to any location the 
                kid wants, and also the option to resize, rotate, and add more than one type of body part. The model for our project is a monster because after all, it is not weird for a monster to have 6 eyes, floating arms, and 
                upside-down features!  
            </p>

            <!-- 2. Design Sketch Section -->
            <h3> Concept Sketches </h3>
            <p> The first step of our design process was to each brainstorm 10 sketches of ideas we had for an interactive app for kids. Since there were 4 of us, there were a total of 40 different ideas! A lot of our ideas revolved 
                being educational and having informative windows pop up when the user clicks on an object. Although most of our ideas were gravitating towards that concept, we ended up choosing something completely different, which 
                was some kind of avatar creation game. We chose this idea because it seemed more exciting and creative, and also because this type of application would most likely be more interesting for small kids, while having the 
                benefit of allowing them to explore their creativty. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Below are the 10 initial sketch ideas that I had:
            </p>

                <img src="img/design-sketch/sketch1.jpg" width="70%">
                <div class="text">The first idea I had was an educational application where kids could learn basic French words that would be used in a household. There would be different
                    screens that are different rooms in a house and would contain items that are normally in that room. When the item is clicked on, then the French translation of it would show up.
                </div>
                </div>

                <img src="img/design-sketch/sketch2.jpg" width="70%">
                <div class="text">  This idea is a game that would show what certain food groups would do to your body. For example, if you fed the person a lot of protein, then muscle would pop up. 
                    The purpose of this would be to teach kids what each nutrition group would do to your body in extreme cases.
                </div>

                <div class="text"> This sketch is a simple game to test how fast your reflexes are. There will be apples that pop up on a tree and kids would click on as many as they can within a time

                <div class="text"> This is a cooking game that will teach kids simple recipes for very basic dishes like scrambled eggs, grilled cheese, etc. The idea would be to have a recipe on the side 
                    of the screen and the kids would just follow the instructions by clicking on the correct step. The purpose of this would be to allow kids to visualize what each step of a recipe would look
                    like and be engaged instead of just reading words off a recipe or watching someone else cook it.

                <div class="text">This idea is an informative app where the setting is a submarine that moves and you look out the window to see different sea creatures swim by. As each creature passes by, if the kid
                    is interested in that animal then they can click on it and it will tell them a fun fact about that animal.

                <div class="text"> This idea is similar to the previous idea with the sea creatures, but in this one the kids will interact with the world map and click on countries that they are interested in learning about.
                    The informative pop-up could include the capital city, fun facts, popular landmarks, food, and national animals.

                <div class="text"> This next idea is a money counting game that teaches kids to be more familiar with how to use change. A total will pop up on the screen and the player will try to create that amount using 
                    the different change options. This will also include how to round the number since pennies aren't used anymore.

                <div class="text"> Once again, this idea is similar to the submarine and world map sketches where an informative screen will show. This time, it involves a muesum that has cool artifacts from around the world 
                    and you can learn about each of them.

                <div class="text"> This is a game where you make a smoothie and every time you add an ingredient in the blender, it will increment the number of calories that smoothie contains. This will get the user to be more familiar

                <div class="text"> This last idea is an interactive periodic table where when you click on an element, it will show real-world examples of that element. The idea of this was to teach kids where each element can be found

            <h3>Sketch Details</h3>
            <p> After deciding on designing an avatar creation app, we expanded on this idea more by coming up with at least 10 sketch refinements/details. We had come up with different variations such as creating monsters, humans, animals and 
                also thought about details such as rotating and resizing parts, and also if we want to click on parts or just drag them onto the avatar.

            <!-- 4. Contribution -->
            <h3>Final Product & Contribution</h3>
            <p> Our final product was the monster variation of our idea. We decided on this variation because monsters are creatures that don't look "normal", so the kids will be able to be more creative of where they place and size 
                different body parts. The functionalities we decided to implement include: being able to resize a feature by holding on a corner of the feature and dragging it inward/outwards; rotating a feature by grabbing the top and 
                spinning the feature; dragging the feature anywhere on the creation box (so floating eyes are a yes!); having different colours for each feature; being able to delete a feature by selecting it and then pressing the garbage icon; 
                and finally, no limit to how many features you can put on!
            </p>
            <p>We coded our application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and used Glitch as our platform. We split up the project by having 2 people focus on the feature illustrations, 1 person focusing on the front-end coding, and 1 person 
                focusing on the back-end coding. From there, if anyone finished their parts early, then they would help out those who are working on the front-end and back-end.
            </p>
            <p>For my contribution to the project, I mainly worked with the front-end coding where I made the layout of the creation screen and inserted icons for each feature. Whenever the illustrations were finished, I would fill in the 
                feature slots with the drawings. Along with that, I also worked on some back-end functionalities such as flipping through the tabs in the features box.
            </p>
