            <!-- 1. Overview-->
            <h3> Overview</h3>
            <p> For this project, our goal was to design and create a creative touch-based and sensor-based screen unlock. We decided to implement a cute cat dress-up interface for the touch-based screen unlock where it involves there
                being 4 cats who have their own outfit. There are accessories at the top of the screen and the goal is to match the correct clothing article combinations to the correct cat in order to unlock your phone. Each cat's outfit is 
                decided beforehand by the user so that they are the only one who knows each cat's tastes. 
            </p>
            <p>For our sensor-based screen unlock, we decided to do a screen unlock that uses the camera as the sensor. The user will see a screen that
                has a coloured cat and also small rectangle showing a camera display. Each cat has a certain facial expression that it wants to see so the goal is to do the correct facial gesture for each coloured cat. 
            </p>

            <!-- 2. Design Sketch Section -->
            <h3> Concept Sketches (Touch) </h3>
            <p> The first step of our design process was to each brainstorm 10 sketches of ideas we had for both touch-based and sensor-based screen unlocks. Since there were 4 of us, there were a total of 40 different ideas for touch-based! We ended up
                choosing one of Yihan's designs for this part which was dressing up cats in their own unique outfit. We picked this because we thought the idea was cute and it also allowed for many different password combinations as each cat can have
                1-5 different accessories simultaneously and also have the same accessories as each other. This way, the password would be more secure. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Below are the 10 initial sketch ideas that I had:
            </p>

                <!-- Full-width images with number and caption text -->

                <img src="img/design-sketch/sketch1.jpg" width="70%">
                <div class="text">The first idea I had was an educational application where kids could learn basic French words that would be used in a household. There would be different
                    screens that are different rooms in a house and would contain items that are normally in that room. When the item is clicked on, then the French translation of it would show up.
                </div>
                </div>
            
                <div class="mySlides1 fade">
                <div class="numbertext">2 / 10</div>
                <img src="img/design-sketch/sketch2.jpg" width="70%">
                <div class="text">  This idea is a game that would show what certain food groups would do to your body. For example, if you fed the person a lot of protein, then muscle would pop up. 
                    The purpose of this would be to teach kids what each nutrition group would do to your body in extreme cases.
                </div>
                </div>

                <img src="img/design-sketch/sketch3.jpg" width="70%">
                <div class="text"> This sketch is a simple game to test how fast your reflexes are. There will be apples that pop up on a tree and kids would click on as many as they can within a time
                    limit.

                <img src="img/design-sketch/sketch4.jpg" width="70%">
                <div class="text"> This is a cooking game that will teach kids simple recipes for very basic dishes like scrambled eggs, grilled cheese, etc. The idea would be to have a recipe on the side 
                    of the screen and the kids would just follow the instructions by clicking on the correct step. The purpose of this would be to allow kids to visualize what each step of a recipe would look
                    like and be engaged instead of just reading words off a recipe or watching someone else cook it.
                </div>

                <div class="text">This idea is an informative app where the setting is a submarine that moves and you look out the window to see different sea creatures swim by. As each creature passes by, if the kid
                    is interested in that animal then they can click on it and it will tell them a fun fact about that animal.
                </div>
                </div>

                <div class="mySlides1 fade">

                <img src="img/design-sketch/sketch6.jpg" width="70%">
                <div class="text"> This idea is similar to the previous idea with the sea creatures, but in this one the kids will interact with the world map and click on countries that they are interested in learning about.
                    The informative pop-up could include the capital city, fun facts, popular landmarks, food, and national animals.

                <div class="text"> This next idea is a money counting game that teaches kids to be more familiar with how to use change. A total will pop up on the screen and the player will try to create that amount using 
                    the different change options. This will also include how to round the number since pennies aren't used anymore.

                <div class="text"> Once again, this idea is similar to the submarine and world map sketches where an informative screen will show. This time, it involves a muesum that has cool artifacts from around the world 
                    and you can learn about each of them.

                <div class="text"> This is a game where you make a smoothie and every time you add an ingredient in the blender, it will increment the number of calories that smoothie contains. This will get the user to be more familiar
                    with how many calories popular foods contain.

                <div class="text"> This last idea is an interactive periodic table where when you click on an element, it will show real-world examples of that element. The idea of this was to teach kids where each element can be found 
                    since looking at letters may not help them with visualizing what the element is.

            <h3>Sketch Details (Touch)</h3>
            <p> After deciding on designing a cat dress-up screen unlock, we expanded on this idea more by coming up with at least 10 sketch refinements/details. We had come up with different variations such as creating monsters, humans, animals and 
                also thought about details such as rotating and resizing parts, and also if we want to click on parts or just drag them onto the avatar.
