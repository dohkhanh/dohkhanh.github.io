            <!-- 1. Overview-->
            <h3> Overview</h3>
            <p> For this project, our goal was to design and create a creative touch-based and sensor-based screen unlock. Mix & Match Cat Lock is a cute cat dress-up interface for the touch-based screen unlock where it involves there
                being 4 cats who have their own outfit. There are accessories at the top of the screen and the goal is to match the correct clothing article combinations to the correct cat in order to unlock your phone. Each cat's outfit is 
                decided beforehand by the user so that they are the only one who knows each cat's tastes. 
            </p>
            <p>For our sensor-based screen unlock, Meowtions Lock is a screen unlock that uses the camera as the sensor. The user will see a screen that
                has a coloured cat and also small rectangle showing a camera display. Each cat has a certain facial expression that it wants to see so the goal is to do the correct facial gesture for each coloured cat. 
            </p>

            <!-- 2. Design Sketch Section -->
            <h3> Concept Sketches </h3>
            <p> The first step of our design process was to each brainstorm 10 sketches of ideas we had for both touch-based and sensor-based screen unlocks. Since there were 4 of us, there were a total of 80 different ideas! We ended up
                choosing one of Yihan's designs for the touch-based part of the project which was dressing up cats in their own unique outfit. We had originally picked another one of Yihan's designs for the sensor-based unlock that involved 
                tilting the phone, but we decided to go for an idea that uses the camera sensor instead and kept the cat aesthetic of Yihan's drawings. The idea we worked on for the sensor-based part involved matching facial expressions to cats. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Below are the 10 initial sketch ideas that I had for the touch-based lock:

            <h3>Sketch Details</h3>
            <p> After deciding on designing a cat dress-up screen unlock for the touch-based, we expanded on this idea more by coming up with 10 sketch refinements/details. We had come up with different variations for how the outfit would get 
                matched to the cat, such as if the outfits would be shown already and you have to pick which cat has that outfit, or if you customize the cats yourself. We also had sketch details on how detailed the accessories were going to be and how 
                the user would need to maneuver their finger in order to customize the cat (tap vs. drag).
            <p>
                Below are our collective 10 refinement sketches (touch):

            <p> We decided on designing a camera-based unlock for the sensor-based one where each cat would correspond to something shown on the camera. We expanded on this idea more by coming up with another 10 sketch refinements/details. We had come up with different variations such as each cat having a unique
                facial gesture, pose, hand gesture, etc. We even had one where each cat would have a specific voice response each instead of using the camera. There were also variations that involved how the sequence of cats would show up. We also had sketch details on timers, or how the cat would react. 
            <p>
            <p>
                Below are our collective 10 refinement sketches (sensor):

            <h3>Final Product & Contribution</h3>
            <p> Our final product for the touch-based part of the project was customizing 4 different cats' outfits using 5 accessories (no colour options). Each accessory can be used by more than one cat and each cat can have a max of 4 accessories on
                since we made the tie and bow have the same placement on the body. We thought this was a good number of cats and accessories to make the password more secure enough as you can have a wide variety of combinations. We also decided on tapping 
                on the accessory, and then tapping on the cat you want the accessory on rather than dragging. Once you are sure each cat has the correct outfit, then the "Finish" button at the bottom of the screen will need to be pressed. If an "X" pops up
                on the screen, you know the password is wrong, and if you see a checkmark then you have successfully unlocked the phone. During the whole process of picking each cats' outfits, the user is never let known whether one or more of the cats are 
                correct and even at the end, they are not revealed if they got any of the outfits correct. This is to prevent strangers from trying to experiment different oufit combinations in order to get into your phone.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p> Our final product for the sensor-based part of the project is matching facial expressions to cats. On the screen will be a certain coloured cat and the coloured cat corresponds to a facial expression that you have decided on beforehand. At the 
                top of the screen will be a box that has the front view of your phone's camera, showing your face. In order to unlock the phone, you must make the correct facial expression and you will know it is correct when the colour of the cat changes. You 
                repeat this with every colour cat that shows up on the screen until you see the lock at the bottom of the screen turn green, which is when you will know that you have successfully unlocked your phone! There is timer on this screen unlock as well 
                to prevent someone from just experimenting random expressions to your phone until it is unlocked.

            <p>We coded our application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and used Glitch and GitHub pages as our platforms. For the sensor-based unlock, we also used a JavaScript face recognition API library (face-api). We split up the project by having 1 person 
                focus on the illustrations for both parts (cats, accessories, etc), 1 person focusing on the touch-based screen unlock, and 2 people working on sensor-based screen unlock. From there, if anyone finished their parts early, then they would help out 
                those who are still working on their parts.
            </p>
            <p>For my contribution to the project, I worked on the front-end and back-end of the touch-based screen unlock. I laid out the objects, added outlines and backgrounds, and implemented the logic for adding accessories onto the cats and checking if the final 
                result was correct.
