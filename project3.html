            <!-- 1. Overview-->
            <h3> Overview</h3>
            <p> TeaMatic is a simple and effective solution to the following everyday problem: oversteeping your tea. Sometimes when steeping tea, it can be annoying or a waste of time to just stand around and wait for it to finish. However,
                if you leave to do something else, there is a possibility that you might get too caught up in your task that you forget about the tea that you're making! Setting a timer on your phone may help to combat this issue, but if you're 
                on a part of your task that you don't want to interrupt, for example a good part of a movie, then it would be inconvenient to have to get up and get your tea before it oversteeps. That is where our product, the TeaMatic, comes in!
                With the TeaMatic, it will automatically raise the tea bag once it is done steeping so that you can fetch your tea whenever it is convenient for you!
            </p>

            <!-- 2. Design Sketch Section -->
            <h3> Concept Sketches </h3>
            <p> The first step of our design process was to each brainstorm 10 sketches of ideas we had for an Arduino product that will solve an everyday problem. Since there were 4 of us, there were a total of 40 different ideas! We ended up choosing
                to do an automatic tea steeper but all of the members in our group were tea drinkers and have experienced this problem before. 
            <p>
                Below are the 10 initial sketch ideas that I had:

            <h3>Sketch Details</h3>
            <p> After deciding on designing an avatar creation app, we expanded on this idea more by coming up with at least 10 sketch refinements/details. We had come up with different variations such as creating monsters, humans, animals and 
                also thought about details such as rotating and resizing parts, and also if we want to click on parts or just drag them onto the avatar.

            <!-- 4. Contribution -->
            <h3>Final Product & Contribution</h3>
            <p> Our final product was the monster variation of our idea. We decided on this variation because monsters are creatures that don't look "normal", so the kids will be able to be more creative of where they place and size 
                different body parts. The functionalities we decided to implement include: being able to resize a feature by holding on a corner of the feature and dragging it inward/outwards; rotating a feature by grabbing the top and 
                spinning the feature; dragging the feature anywhere on the creation box (so floating eyes are a yes!); having different colours for each feature; being able to delete a feature by selecting it and then pressing the garbage icon; 
                and finally, no limit to how many features you can put on!
            </p>
            <p>We coded our application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and used Glitch as our platform. We split up the project by having 2 people focus on the feature illustrations, 1 person focusing on the front-end coding, and 1 person 
                focusing on the back-end coding. From there, if anyone finished their parts early, then they would help out those who are working on the front-end and back-end.
            </p>
            <p>For my contribution to the project, I mainly worked with the front-end coding where I made the layout of the creation screen and inserted icons for each feature. Whenever the illustrations were finished, I would fill in the 
                feature slots with the drawings. Along with that, I also worked on some back-end functionalities such as flipping through the tabs in the features box.
            </p>
