            <!-- 1. Overview-->
            <h3> Overview</h3>
            <p> TeaMatic is a simple and effective solution to the following everyday problem: oversteeping your tea. Sometimes when steeping tea, it can be annoying or a waste of time to just stand around and wait for it to finish. However,
                if you leave to do something else, there is a possibility that you might get too caught up in your task that you forget about the tea that you're making! Setting a timer on your phone may help to combat this issue, but if you're 
                on a part of your task that you don't want to interrupt, for example a good part of a movie, then it would be inconvenient to have to get up and get your tea before it oversteeps. That is where our product, the TeaMatic, comes in!
                With the TeaMatic, it will automatically raise the tea bag once it is done steeping so that you can fetch your tea whenever it is convenient for you! 
            </p>

            <!-- 2. Design Sketch Section -->
            <h3> Concept Sketches </h3>
            <p> The first step of our design process was to each brainstorm 10 sketches of ideas we had for an Arduino product that will solve an everyday problem. Since there were 4 of us, there were a total of 40 different ideas! We ended up choosing
                to do an automatic tea steeper but all of the members in our group were tea drinkers and have experienced this problem before. 
            <p>
                Below are the 10 initial sketch ideas that I had:

            <h3>Sketch Details</h3>
            <p> After deciding on creating an automatic tea steeper, we expanded on this idea by coming up with multiple sketche refinements/details. We had come up with different button types for the tea steeper,
                different ways of lowering the tea bag, and any additional details that would be useful for the user to have such as temperature control and indicators.  
            </p>

            <!-- 4. Concept Video -->
            <h3>Concept Video</h3>
            <p> After choosing the tea steeper concept as our idea, we created a concept video that included how this useful would be helpful, and how we would imagine someone using it. 
            </p>
            
            <!-- 5. Contribution -->
            <h3>Final Product & Contribution</h3>
            <p> Our final product of the tea steeper concept is the TeaMatic! (Include which features we included and why and also design choices and why)
            </p>
            <p>We coded our product using C++ and created our product using the Arduino. We split up the project by having 1 person take home the Arduino kit to put it all together and record the final demo video, and the rest 
                of the group split the rest of the tasks amongst eachother. These tasks included: creating the simulation on TinkerCAD, making the concept video, making the storyboard for the final demo, and writing the description 
                to justify and explain the features and design choices made for our project. 
            </p>
            <p>For my contribution to the project, I worked on different simulations for the tea steeper on TinkerCAD to allow the group member who took the kit home to put together the project easier. I also wrote out a storyboard for
                the final demo video so that they could record it easier too. 
            </p>
