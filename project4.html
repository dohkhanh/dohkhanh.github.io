            <!-- 1. Overview-->
            <h3> Overview</h3>
            <p> For our project, we decided to do an AR battle system where players would be able to fight eachother with their characters (ex. scary, cute, or human-like monsters), similar to how Pokemon battles work. In our application, players enter a 
                username and are then sent to a game lobby where they can request other players to battle, or simply chat. Once a battle request is accepted, players will enter a screen that has a camera AR interface 
                on the top portion of the screen that shows an AR figure of their opponent's character in battle. The bottom of this screen will have the actions that you can choose for your character to do (such as attack, heal, run). 
            </p>
            <p> This system is a type of communication between players to fight each other online, but at the same time, see what is going on in real-life through AR. We thought that allowing the user to see the online battle with 
                where they are as the background would make the battle experience more immersive. 
            </p>

            <!-- 2. Design Sketch Section -->
            <h3> Concept Sketches </h3>
            <p> The first step of our design process was to each brainstorm 10 sketches of ideas we had for a novel interface to augment communcation and collaboration.

            <p>
                Below are the 10 initial sketch ideas that I had:

            <!-- 6. Contribution -->
            <h3>Implementation & Contribution</h3>
            <p> In the end, our project involved players entering a username and getting sent to a game lobby where they can request other players to battle. As shown in our concept video and sketch refinements, we originally wanted
                to have a GPS system where players are detected in-person when they are nearby, and from there they can request to battle. In this way, both the opponent's AR and the opponent themself is shown in the camera interface. 
                Unfortunately due to the time constraints, we were unable to implement the GPS system and replaced it with a lobby system instead, causing the type of communication to go from in-person to remote. However, we believe that
                this implementation is a good starting point in making an AR battle application that involves both remote and in-person communication rather than just one. 
            </p>
            <p>We coded our application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and used Glitch as our platform. We also heavily used the socket.io API to code the server between players. 
                We split up the project by having 2 people focus on the back-end coding, 1 person on the front-end, and the last person on the concept/final video creations while also helping a bit on front-end.  
            </p>
            <p>For my contribution to the project, I helped work on the back-end where I mostly focused on implementing the battle logic with the server that the other back-end groupmate created. 
            </p>
