            <!-- 1. Overview-->
            <h3> Overview</h3>
            <p> For our project, we decided to do an AR battle system where players would be able to fight eachother with their characters, similar to how Pokemon battles work. The idea is that when you walk past
                another person who has this application open on their phone, you would both get a notification indicating that there is a potential player to battle. Once the battle request is accepted on both ends, 
                players will enter a screen that has a camera interface on the top portion of the screen that shows the other player and also an AR figure of their character in battle. The bottom of this screen will
                have the actions that you can choose for your character to do (attack, heal, run). 
            </p>
            <p> We believe this idea is novel because there is not anything out there that does this specifically. Although Pokemon GO exists and uses the GPS to catch Pokemon, and battle trainers/gyms, there is no actual
                combat between the players, so we wanted to create something that would replicate that experience. This system is a type of communication between players to fight each other in a different world and encourages 
                people to go out more in order to meet/fight new people. Although the goal of this application seems to be to level up your character, it is actually to allow people to have something else to do with eachother. 
            </p>

            <!-- 2. Design Sketch Section -->
            <h3> Concept Sketches </h3>
            <p> The first step of our design process was to each brainstorm 10 sketches of ideas we had for a novel interface to augment communcation and collaboration.

            <p>
                Below are the 10 initial sketch ideas that I had:

            <h3>Sketch Details</h3>
            <p> After deciding on creating an automatic tea steeper, we expanded on this idea by coming up with multiple sketche refinements/details. We had come up with different button types for the tea steeper,
                different ways of lowering the tea bag, and any additional details that would be useful for the user to have such as temperature control and indicators.

            <h3>Implementation & Contribution</h3>
            <p>We coded our product using C++ and created our product using the Arduino. We split up the project by having 1 person take home the Arduino kit to put it all together and record the final demo video, and the rest 
                of the group split the rest of the tasks amongst eachother. These tasks included: creating the simulation on TinkerCAD, making the concept video, making the storyboard for the final demo, and writing the description 
                to justify and explain the features and design choices made for our project. 
            </p>
            <p>For my contribution to the project, I worked on different simulations for the tea steeper on TinkerCAD to allow the group member who took the kit home to put together the project easier. I also wrote out a storyboard for
                the final demo video so that they could record it easier too. 
            </p>
